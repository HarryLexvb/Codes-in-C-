## EXERCISE COMBINING ARRAYS

#### Description: 

One hot summer day, Peter and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the largest and most mature (in their opinion). The watermelon was then weighed and the balance showed $$w$$ kilograms. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to split the watermelon, however, they faced a difficult problem.

Pete and Billy are big fans of even numbers, so they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs an even number of kilos, at the same time the parts do not have to be equal. The kids are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, so they need to help out and find out if they can split the sand the way they want. Of course, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

 **Input:**

The first (and only) line of input contains the integer $$w(1 \leq w \leq 100)$$ the weight of the watermelon bought by the children.

 **Ouput:**

Write YES if the children can divide the watermelon into two parts, each an even number of kilograms; and NO in the opposite case.

#### Example:

| Input  | Ouput |   
|--------|--------| 
| 8         | Yes      |

The console display will be something like this:

**Input:**

Enter sa number:  8 

**Output:**

Yes
