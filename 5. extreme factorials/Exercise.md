## EXERCISE EXTREME FACTORIALS

#### Description: [Extreme factorials exercise](https://omegaup.com/arena/problem/Factoriales-extremos/#problems")

Hugo el Ferret was solving his math homework, but since he doesn't like to do calculations by hand, he used his new OMI-9000 calculator that he bought for 10 pesos at the Mexico City Metro Collective Transport System.

But there came a time when his calculator did not help him much, since it did not support more than 6 digits to do operations (he could not expect much from a 10-peso calculator).

That is why you need a program to help you calculate the mathematical operation N! % M. Hugo remembers that the factorial of a number is defined as:

Fact(N) = N * Fact(N - 1)

Fact(0) = 1

After you have calculated N!, you must take out modulo M.

He has an example: 13! %23 = 6227020800 %23 = 18

**Input:**

A single line with two positive integers N and M.

**Ouput:**

The result of the operation N! %M

#### Example:

| Input N  |Input M | Output |
|----------|----------|---------|
|  13         | 23          |18          |

**Limits:**

N will fit into a signed integer,

The console display will be something like this: 23 <= M <= 1007

**Input:**

Enter N:  13
Enter M:  23

**Output:**

18
