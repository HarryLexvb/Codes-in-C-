## EXERCISE SERPENTINE MATRIX

#### Description:

Write a program that, given two integers $$M, N$$ , builds a matrix with $$M$$ rows and $$N$$ columns whose inputs are the numbers $$ 1, 2, . . . , M . N $$  arranged as a streamer, starting with the $$1$$ at input (0,0), going right (to the end of the line), then down one position, going left (to the beginning line), then one position down and so on (see example).

**Input:**

It consists of two positive integers, $$M, N$$ (both less than 20), separated by a space.

**Ouput:**

The required matrix must have $$M$$ rows, each with $$N$$ integers separated by spaces.

#### Example:

| Rows  | Columns |   
|-------|------------| 
|       4  | 5              |

The console display will be something like this:

**Input:**

Enter rows:  4
Enter columns:  5

**Output:**
